Project Details

Exploratory Data Analysis

The project begins by exploring the dataset to understand key characteristics, such as distributions of the target variable (price) and the main feature (sqft_living). Insights from the analysis guided the modeling choices.

Linear Regression Modeling

The notebook builds a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on the sqft_living feature. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Polynomial Regression

Since a purely linear model showed limitations, the project proceeds to use polynomial regression. This approach allows for capturing non-linear relationships between the variables, providing a more flexible model for house price prediction.

Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the models, the following metrics were used:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R-squared Value (RÂ²)

The visualizations included a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted prices, which indicated areas where the model was overestimating or underestimating house prices.

Further Improvements

The current model shows potential but also provides opportunities for improvement:

Feature Engineering: Create additional features to improve model accuracy.

Regularization: Introduce Ridge or Lasso regularization to handle overfitting.

Advanced Algorithms: Experiment with more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

Outlier Handling: Identify and handle outliers in the dataset.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like grid search for optimizing model parameters.
