# Linear Regression Project

## Overview

This project is focused on demonstrating the concepts and practical implementation of Linear Regression, a fundamental technique in machine learning used for predictive modeling. We'll be predicting house prices based on features from a real estate dataset. The project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook to walk through the steps of applying linear regression on a dataset, covering data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab**

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Ayodimeji1/Linear_Regression.git
   cd Linear_Regression-main
   ```
   
2. **Install required packages**:
   ```
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open `Linear_Regression.ipynb`** in the Jupyter interface and execute the cells step-by-step to follow the analysis and model implementation.

## Dependencies

- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding environment

## Configuration

- **Data File**: Ensure any dataset needed is placed in the correct path or modified in the notebook to point to the location of your data file.
- **Python Environment**: Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

## Project Details

The notebook provides a hands-on approach to understanding linear regression. It includes:

- **Simple Linear Regression**: Modeling a single feature against a target variable.
- **Multiple Linear Regression**: Extending to multiple features for more robust predictive capabilities.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Discusses and displays metrics like R-squared, MSE, and visualizations to assess model performance.
